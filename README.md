# Python-Challenge
HW3 - PyMeUp Charlie


Directories were created via Gitbash called PyBank and PyPoll.
Each directory contains a:
- Python file, main.py, to hold main script
- "Resources" folder that contains the CSV files to be analyzed
- Empty "Analysis" folder that will populate with a text file that has the results of the analysis



PyBank
Python script was created that calculated:
- total number of months included in the dataset
- net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
- changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, then find the average of those changes
- greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
- greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period



PyPoll
Python script was created that calculated:
- total number of votes cast
- complete list of candidates who received votes
- percentage of votes each candidate won
- total number of votes each candidate won
- winner of the election based on popular vote



Final script prints the analysis to the terminal and exports the results to a text file
